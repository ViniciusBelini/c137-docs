  ``Cookies`` are a feature within ``History`` that allow you to rate the
  quality of the model's generated responses. They function as a score from 0 to
  1, where:
---

# üç™ Cookie

* **0:** The response was completely ineffective and unhelpful.
* **1:** The response was extremely useful and satisfactory.

**The closer the cookie value is to 1, the more satisfied you are with the response.**

You can assign this rating within the "History" to evaluate each text generated by the model. This helps the model learn with each generation, preventing it from producing texts with low scores and aiming to generate texts with higher scores.

## Basic Example

To include an instruction in your request, simply add a key-value pair to your request. The key should be "cookie" and the value should be the rate you want to provide.

Here's a Python example:

```python
import requests

URL = "https://c137.belini.shop/api/generateText"
KEY = "YOUR KEY HERE"

history = '''{
    "2023-10-26 10:00:00": {"user": "My name is John"}, 
    "2023-10-26 10:00:30": {"model": "Your name is Doe.", "cookie":0}
}'''

data = {
    "key": KEY,
    "history" = history,
    "text": "What is my name?"
}

response = requests.post(URL, data=data)

print(f'Status: {response.status_code}')

print('------------------------------------------')
print(response.text)
print('------------------------------------------')
```

If your key is valid, the response will look something like this:

{% hint style="success" %}
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "code": 200,
    "message": "All working successfully.",
    "generated_text": "Your name is John."
}
```
{% endhint %}
